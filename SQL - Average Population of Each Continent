Given the CITY and COUNTRY tables, query the names of all the continents (COUNTRY.Continent) and their respective average city populations (CITY.Population) rounded down to the nearest integer.

Note: CITY.CountryCode and COUNTRY.Code are matching key columns.

SELECT co.CONTINENT, FLOOR(AVG(ci.POPULATION))
FROM CITY ci
JOIN COUNTRY co ON ci.CountryCode = co.code
GROUP BY co.CONTINENT;
